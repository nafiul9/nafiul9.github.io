# About Me

## Education
- **Ph.D. Candidate in Biological Sciences** - Auburn University
  - Research Focus: Quantitative genetics of sexually dimorphic traits and hormone signaling
  - Model Organism: *Drosophila melanogaster*

## Research Interests
- Quantitative Genetics
- Molecular Genetics
- Hormone Signaling Pathways
- Sexual Dimorphism
- Endocrine Disruption
- Developmental Biology

## Research Overview
My research at Auburn University focuses on understanding the complex interactions between genetics and hormone signaling in sexual dimorphism. Using *Drosophila melanogaster* as a model organism, I investigate how endocrine disruptors impact hormone signaling pathways and contribute to changes in sexually dimorphic traits.
