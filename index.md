## Current Research
I am investigating the complex interactions between genetics and hormone signaling in sexual dimorphism using *Drosophila melanogaster* as a model organism at Auburn University's Department of Biological Sciences.

## Research Focus Areas

###  Quantitative Genetics
Investigating the genetic basis of sexual dimorphism in *Drosophila melanogaster*, focusing on how genetic variations contribute to sex-specific trait development.

###  Molecular Genetics
Studying the molecular mechanisms underlying hormone signaling and regulatory variation, with particular emphasis on genes involved in sexual differentiation.

###  Hormone Signaling
Examining the impact of endocrine disruptors on hormone signaling pathways and their effects on sexual dimorphism in *Drosophila melanogaster*.

## Research Impact
- Understanding fundamental mechanisms of sexual dimorphism
- Mapping hormone signaling pathways and their regulation
- Analyzing effects of environmental factors on endocrine systems
- Uncovering genetic basis of sex-specific trait development

## Recent Work
Currently investigating how endocrine disruptors impact hormone signaling pathways and contribute to changes in sexually dimorphic traits, combining approaches from quantitative genetics, molecular biology, and endocrinology.
