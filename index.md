## Current Research
<div class="research-highlight">
  I am investigating the complex interactions between genetics and hormone signaling in sexual dimorphism using *Drosophila melanogaster* as a model organism at Auburn University`'`s Department of Biological Sciences.
</div>

## Research Focus Areas

<div class="research-grid">
  <div class="research-card">
    <h3> Quantitative Genetics</h3>
    <p>Investigating the genetic basis of sexual dimorphism in *Drosophila melanogaster*, focusing on how genetic variations contribute to sex-specific trait development.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="research-card">
    <h3> Molecular Genetics</h3>
    <p>Studying the molecular mechanisms underlying hormone signaling and regulatory variation, with particular emphasis on genes involved in sexual differentiation.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="research-card">
    <h3> Hormone Signaling</h3>
    <p>Examining the impact of endocrine disruptors on hormone signaling pathways and their effects on sexual dimorphism in *Drosophila melanogaster*.</p>
  </div>
</div>

## Research Impact
<div class="impact-list">
  - Understanding fundamental mechanisms of sexual dimorphism
  - Mapping hormone signaling pathways and their regulation
  - Analyzing effects of environmental factors on endocrine systems
