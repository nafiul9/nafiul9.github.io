# Welcome to My Research Portfolio

## Current Research
I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Biological Sciences at Auburn University. My research focuses on understanding the complex interactions between genetics and hormone signaling in sexual dimorphism using *Drosophila melanogaster* as a model organism.

## Research Focus Areas

### Quantitative Genetics of Sexually Dimorphic Traits
Investigating the genetic basis of sexual dimorphism in *Drosophila melanogaster*, focusing on how genetic variations contribute to sex-specific trait development.

### Molecular Genetics and Gene Regulation
Studying the molecular mechanisms underlying hormone signaling and regulatory variation, with particular emphasis on genes involved in sexual differentiation.

### Hormone Signaling Research
Examining the impact of endocrine disruptors on hormone signaling pathways and their effects on sexual dimorphism in *Drosophila melanogaster*.

## Research Impact
This research contributes to our understanding of:
- Fundamental mechanisms of sexual dimorphism
- Hormone signaling pathways and their regulation
- Effects of environmental factors on endocrine systems
- Genetic basis of sex-specific trait development

## Recent Work
Currently investigating how endocrine disruptors impact hormone signaling pathways and contribute to changes in sexually dimorphic traits, combining approaches from quantitative genetics, molecular biology, and endocrinology.
